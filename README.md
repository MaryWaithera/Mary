Software Engineering Day1 Assignment
Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering


Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
It systematically applies engineering principles,methods and tools to develope and maintain high-quality software systems.
IMPORTANCE - it ensures that the software developed is of high-quality reducing the likelihood of bugs, security vulnerabilities and that it's reliable.
  2) itimproves efficiency and productivity of the products.
  3) Enables experimentals and creation of new innovation.

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
 1) Planning -it involves determining the objectives, scope and feasibility of the project.
 2) Requiremnt analysis -  the specific needs of users are colected and documented.
 3) Designing - it involves creating the architecture of the software with all its componets(database,user interface).
 4) Implementation - it involves developing the software based on the model designed on the previous stage.
 5) Testing - it involves debugging the software from any errors.
 6) Deployment and maintanance - the software is deployed to the environment where users and access it and use it. The deployed software is monitored
    for any issues and updated when needed.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
 1) Waterfall follows a linear structured process where each is stage is completed before moving to the next while for agile methodolgy breaks the process
    into smaller, repetative cycles called sprints.
 2) Agile is highly adaptable to changes while waterfall methodology is challenging to make any changes once a phase is complete.
 3) Agile methodology continuously does testing after every sprint hence easily detects risks which can be mitigated without causing alot of damage as compared
    to waterfall where testing is done towards the end of the development cycle hence some risks and errors detected can bring about alot of changes to the project.
4) Waterfall is suitable for projects that have well defined requirements with no need for changes in the future while for agile methodology does not necessary
   require them to be defined for it allows any changes.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
 Software developer - Responsible for designing and implementing software solutions based on the requirements, regularly does debugging on their own and 
 create and maintain documentation of the software.
 Qality Assurance Engineeer - Responsible for creating detailed test plans, test cases, and test scripts based on the requirements and design documents.
 Project Manager - Responsible for defining the scope of the project, creating detailed project plans, and establishing timelines. 

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
 Importance of IEDs 
  1) increases productivity
  2) Easier error detection and debugging due to powerful detection tools.
  3) Has extensions that integrate additional tools and libraries such as database tools.
     Example is the Visual Studio Code.
Importance of VCS
 1) VCS enables multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously without overwriting each otherâ€™s work.
 2) Has version tracking and maintains history allowing developers to track back on the changes made.
 3) It acts as a backup system for the codebase.
    Example is Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
 1) Time management and meeting deadline. Can solved using project management tools like Trello to track tasks.
 2) Change of requirements. Having a one to one communication with the stakeholders to understand and listen to their ideas is one way tho avoid this challenge.
 3) Debgging and fixing - Using systematic approaches to debugging, such as unit testing can be one of the solutions.
 4) Rapid change with the technolgy- Can be solved by continously learning and experimenting with new tools and technologies.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.




Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
It is practice of designing and optimizing input prompts to interact effectively with AI models.
Importance- controllng the output and handling complex queries.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
